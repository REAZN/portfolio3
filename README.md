# Portfolio 3

Part of three portfolios developed for a university assignment to evaluate the UI and UX of modern web design trends. Each portfolio has three sections, about, projects, and experiments. All three portfolios created contain the same information (text, images, icons, etc) as each other to keep the UX and UI of each site the primary focus of evaluation.

### Portfolio 3's key properties

- Multi-page with scroll hijacking for page navigation.
- Subtle animations, and inclusion of interactive elements.
- Glassmorphic design inspirations with light usage of blurred background elements.
- Dark colour scheme with dark blue/purple accents.
